This plan provides a structured approach to migrate the monolith to microservices on AWS with minimal downtime and a focus on data correctness. Each step can be expanded with detailed tasks, assignments, and timelines in subsequent iterations.

## 1. Pre-migration Assessment and Planning
   - **Application Inventory**: List all endpoints, background jobs, dependencies, and third-party integrations.
   - **Microservices Boundaries**: Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to identify bounded contexts and define service boundaries.
   - **Database Analysis**: Document all tables, relationships, and data access patterns. Identify potential challenges in breaking the database.
   - **Non-functional Requirements**: Define SLAs, scalability, security, and compliance requirements.
   - **Migration Goals**: Set clear milestones and success metrics (e.g., reduce latency, improve deployment frequency).
   - **Risk Assessment & Rollback Strategy**: identify risks, dependencies, and rollback approach.
## 2. Architecture Design
   - **Microservices Architecture**: Each service is independently deployable, scalable, and focused on a single business capability.
   - **Data Management**: Each service owns its data. Use events for inter-service communication to maintain data consistency.
   - **API Design**: Design APIs for each service. Use API Gateway as a single entry point.
   - **Communication Patterns**: Use synchronous communication (HTTP/REST) for immediate responses and asynchronous (message queues) for background tasks.
   - **Security**: Implement OAuth2/JWT for authentication, and use AWS Secrets Manager for secrets.
   - **Observability**: Centralized logging, metrics, and distributed tracing.
## 3. Infrastructure Setup on AWS
   - **Networking**: VPC with public and private subnets. Security groups and NACLs for network security.
   - **Containerization**: Dockerize each microservice. Use Amazon ECS (Fargate) for orchestration to reduce management overhead.
   - **Database**: Initially, use RDS for SQL Server to host the monolith's database. For each new microservice, choose the appropriate database (may be Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, etc.).
   - **Message Bus**: Use Amazon SNS/SQS for decoupled communication or EventBridge for event-driven architecture.
   - **API Gateway**: Configure routes to microservices and the monolith.
   - **Service Discovery**: Use AWS Cloud Map for service discovery if not using API Gateway for routing.
   - **CI/CD**: Set up pipelines for each microservice to automate testing and deployment.
   - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform/CloudFormation to ensure reproducible environments.
## 4. Migration & Data Strategy (Strangler Fig Pattern)
   - **Lift and Shift**: Deploy the monolith to AWS (EC2 or ECS) to reduce latency and simplify the migration.
   - **Extract Module**: Choose a low-risk, loosely coupled module to extract first.
   - **Implement Microservice**: Develop the microservice in .NET Core, containerize it, and set up its own database.
   - **Data Migration Options**: 
     - **Dual Writes**: Write to both the old and new databases simultaneously.  
     - **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Use AWS DMS or Debezium to capture changes from the monolith's database and apply them to the new database.  
   - **Traffic Routing**: Use API Gateway to route specific requests to the new microservice. Gradually shift traffic.
   - **Data Validation**: Use scripts to compare data between old and new databases to ensure correctness.
   - **Rollback Plan per Module**: Define safe rollback criteria for each service extraction.
## 5. Testing Strategy
   - **Unit Tests**: For each service.
   - **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between services and with databases.
   - **End-to-End Tests**: Test critical user journeys across the system.
   - **Performance Tests**: Load test each service and the system as a whole.
   - **Chaos Tests**: Introduce failures to test resilience.
## 6. Cutover
   - **Final Sync**: Plan for a period of minimal activity to perform the final data sync.
   - **Switch Over**: Direct all traffic to microservices instead of the monolith.
   - **Validation**: Verify functionality and data consistency immediately after cutover.
## 7. Go-Live & Stabilization
   - **Post-Cutover Monitoring**: Closely monitor system health, latency, and error rates immediately after switch-over.
   - **Functional Validation**: Ensure all services and user flows are working as expected in production.
   - **Performance Tuning**: Adjust resource allocation and service configurations based on real-world load.
   - **Early Cost Review**: Validate initial AWS cost assumptions against actual usage.
   - **Retire Monolith Components**: Remove unused modules from the monolith once fully replaced.
   - **Shutdown Legacy Systems**: Decommission infrastructure and databases no longer in use.
   - **Post-Mortem Review**: Document lessons learned and update best practices for future migrations.
## 8. Operations & Maintenance
   - **Observability**: Centralized logging (CloudWatch), metrics, and distributed tracing (X-Ray).
   - **Auto-scaling**: Configure auto-scaling for each service based on load and demand patterns.
   - **Resilience**: Regular backups, disaster recovery drills, and chaos testing in production-like environments.
   - **Cost Optimization**: Ongoing review of AWS resource usage, rightsizing, and reserved instances where applicable.
   - **Runbooks & On-call**: Maintain incident response playbooks and ensure proper on-call coverage.
   - **Continuous Improvement**: Collect feedback, measure SLAs, and refine processes.
