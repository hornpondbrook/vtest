This plan provides a structured approach to migrate the monolith to microservices on AWS with minimal downtime and a focus on data correctness. Each step can be expanded with detailed tasks, assignments, and timelines in subsequent iterations.

## 1. Pre-migration Assessment and Planning
   - **Application Inventory**: List all endpoints, background jobs, dependencies, and third-party integrations.
   - **Microservices Boundaries**: Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to identify bounded contexts and define service boundaries.
   - **Database Analysis**: Document all tables, relationships, and data access patterns. Identify potential challenges in breaking the database.
   - **Non-functional Requirements**: Define SLAs, scalability, security, and compliance requirements.
   - **Migration Goals**: Set clear milestones and success metrics (e.g., reduce latency, improve deployment frequency).
## 2. Architecture Design
   - **Microservices Architecture**: Each service is independently deployable, scalable, and focused on a single business capability.
   - **Data Management**: Each service owns its data. Use events for inter-service communication to maintain data consistency.
   - **API Design**: Design APIs for each service. Use API Gateway as a single entry point.
   - **Communication Patterns**: Use synchronous communication (HTTP/REST) for immediate responses and asynchronous (message queues) for background tasks.
   - **Security**: Implement OAuth2/JWT for authentication, and use AWS Secrets Manager for secrets.
   - **Observability**: Centralized logging, metrics, and distributed tracing.
## 3. Infrastructure Setup on AWS
   - **Networking**: VPC with public and private subnets. Security groups and NACLs for network security.
   - **Containerization**: Dockerize each microservice. Use Amazon ECS (Fargate) for orchestration to reduce management overhead.
   - **Database**: Initially, use RDS for SQL Server to host the monolith's database. For each new microservice, choose the appropriate database (may be Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, etc.).
   - **Message Bus**: Use Amazon SNS/SQS for decoupled communication or EventBridge for event-driven architecture.
   - **API Gateway**: Configure routes to microservices and the monolith.
   - **Service Discovery**: Use AWS Cloud Map for service discovery if not using API Gateway for routing.
   - **CI/CD**: Set up pipelines for each microservice to automate testing and deployment.
## 4. Migration Process (Strangler Fig Pattern)
   - **Lift and Shift**: Deploy the monolith to AWS (EC2 or ECS) to reduce latency and simplify the migration.
   - **Extract Module**: Choose a low-risk, loosely coupled module to extract first.
   - **Implement Microservice**: Develop the microservice in .NET Core, containerize it, and set up its own database.
   - **Data Migration**: Use dual writes or CDC to keep the monolith's database and the new service's database in sync.
   - **Traffic Routing**: Use API Gateway to route specific requests to the new microservice. Gradually shift traffic.
   - **Decommission**: Once the microservice is stable and the monolith's module is no longer used, remove it from the monolith.
## 5. Data Migration Strategy
   - **Dual Writes**: Write to both the old and new databases simultaneously. This allows for a gradual transition but requires handling failures to avoid data inconsistency.
   - **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Use AWS DMS or Debezium to capture changes from the monolith's database and apply them to the new database.
   - **Data Validation**: Use scripts to compare data between old and new databases to ensure correctness.
   - **Cutover Plan**: Plan for a period of minimal activity to perform the final data sync and switch over.
## 6. Testing Strategy
   - **Unit Tests**: For each service.
   - **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between services and with databases.
   - **End-to-End Tests**: Test critical user journeys across the system.
   - **Performance Tests**: Load test each service and the system as a whole.
   - **Chaos Tests**: Introduce failures to test resilience.
## 7. Go-Live and Post-Migration
   - **Cutover**: Execute the final data migration and switch traffic to the new system.
   - **Monitoring**: Closely monitor system health and performance.
   - **Validation**: Ensure all functionality is working as expected.
   - **Optimization**: Tune performance and cost based on real-world usage.
## 8. Operations and Maintenance
   - **Logging and Monitoring**: Use CloudWatch for logs and metrics, X-Ray for tracing.
   - **Auto-scaling**: Configure auto-scaling for each service based on load.
   - **Backup and DR**: Regular backups and a disaster recovery plan.
   - **Cost Optimization**: Regularly review and optimize AWS resource usage.
