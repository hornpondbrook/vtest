This plan provides a structured approach to migrate the monolith to microservices on AWS with minimal downtime and a focus on data correctness. Each step can be expanded with detailed tasks, assignments, and timelines in subsequent iterations.

## 1. Pre-migration Assessment and Planning
   - **Application Inventory**: List all endpoints, background jobs, dependencies, and third-party integrations.
   - **Microservices Boundaries**: Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to identify bounded contexts and define service boundaries.
   - **Database Analysis**: Document all tables, relationships, and data access patterns. Identify potential challenges in breaking the database.
   - **Non-functional Requirements**: Define SLAs, scalability, security, and compliance requirements.
   - **Migration Goals**: Set clear milestones and success metrics (e.g., reduce latency, improve deployment frequency).
   - **Risk Assessment & Rollback Strategy**: identify risks, dependencies, and rollback approach.
## 2. Foundational Setup
   - **Tooling and Standards Definition**: Establish standards for coding, API design (e.g., RESTful maturity model, gRPC), containerization, and IaC before development begins.
   - **CI/CD Blueprints**: Create reusable CI/CD pipeline templates for building, testing, and deploying microservices to ensure consistency.
   - **Shared Infrastructure Provisioning**: Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision foundational AWS components like the VPC, subnets, IAM roles, and the initial API Gateway setup.
   - **Observability Stack Setup**: Configure centralized logging (CloudWatch), metrics (Prometheus/Grafana), and distributed tracing (X-Ray/OpenTelemetry) before the first service is migrated.   
## 3. Architecture Design
   - **Microservices Architecture**: Each service is independently deployable, scalable, and focused on a single business capability.
   - **Data Management**: Each service owns its data. Use events for inter-service communication to maintain data consistency.
   - **API Design**: Design APIs for each service. Use API Gateway as a single entry point.
   - **Communication Patterns**: Use synchronous communication (HTTP/REST/gRPC) for immediate responses and asynchronous (message queues) for background tasks.
   - **Security**: Implement a zero-trust model with OAuth2/JWT for service-to-service and user authentication. Use AWS Secrets Manager for secrets and KMS for encryption.
   - **Observability**: Centralized logging, metrics, and distributed tracing.
## 4. Infrastructure Setup on AWS
   - **Compute**: Containerize all microservices using Docker. Use ECS with Fargate as the default orchestration platform for simplicity and serverless scaling. Consider EKS for workloads that need advanced Kubernetes features or multi-cloud portability. Use AWS Lambda for lightweight, event-driven connectors and background tasks. Ensure proper resource sizing and auto-scaling for ECS/EKS and Lambda functions.
   - **Data**: Use Amazon RDS/Aurora for relational databases, matching your current SQL Server schemas if migrating. For high-throughput key-value workloads, use DynamoDB, and employ ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached) for caching frequently accessed data. Use S3 for storing artifacts, logs, and large objects, with lifecycle policies for cost optimization. Consider cross-region replication for critical data.
   - **Message Bus**: Use Amazon SNS/SQS for decoupled messaging between services. For event-driven architecture, leverage EventBridge, ensuring proper schema management and retry policies. Include dead-letter queues for error handling.
   - **Networking/Security**: Design a VPC with public and private subnets, NAT gateways for outbound access, and security groups/NACLs for granular access control. Implement IAM roles per service, Secrets Manager/Parameter Store for credentials, and KMS for encryption at rest. Apply least-privilege principles and audit IAM policies regularly.
   - **API Gateway**: Serve as a single entry point to route requests to microservices or the monolith. Implement rate limiting, throttling, and caching at the gateway level to enhance performance and reliability.
   - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Define all infrastructure using Terraform or CloudFormation to ensure reproducible, version-controlled environments. Include modular templates for common patterns (VPC, RDS, ECS/EKS clusters, networking).
## 5. Incremental Migration Execution (Strangler Fig Pattern)
   - **Lift and Shift Monolith (Optional but Recommended)**: Deploy the monolith to AWS (EC2 or ECS) to reduce network latency between it and the new microservices during the transition.
   - **Identify and Prioritize the First Module**: Choose a low-risk, loosely coupled module with minimal dependencies to extract first as a pilot.
   - **Implement the First Microservice**: Develop the microservice in .NET Core, containerize it, and set up its own database and CI/CD pipeline based on the established blueprints.
   - **Data Synchronization Strategy**: 
     - **Dual Writes**: Write to both the old and new databases simultaneously.  
     - **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Use AWS DMS or Debezium to capture changes from the monolith's database and apply them to the new database.  
   - **Traffic Routing**: Use API Gateway to route specific requests to the new microservice. Gradually shift traffic.
   - **Data Validation and Reconciliation**: Implement automated scripts to continuously compare data between the old and new databases to ensure correctness during the migration phase.
   - **Decommission Monolith Module**: Once 100% of traffic is routed to the new service and data is validated, decommission the corresponding code and database tables from the monolith.
   - **Iterate**: Repeat the process for the next prioritized module.
## 6. Testing Strategy
   - **Unit Tests**: For each service's internal logic.
   - **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between a service and its direct dependencies (e.g., database, message queue).
   - **Contract Tests**: Ensure that services adhere to their API contracts to prevent breaking changes between consumers and providers.
   - **End-to-End Tests**: Test critical user journeys that span multiple services.
   - **Performance Tests**: Load test each service and the system as a whole to validate non-functional requirements.
   - **Resilience and Chaos Tests**: Intentionally introduce failures (e.g., service downtime, network latency) to test system resilience and fallback mechanisms.
## 7. Go-Live, Stabilization, and Iteration
   - **Continuous Go-Live**: Recognize that "Go-Live" is not a single event but a continuous process of incrementally strangling the monolith.
   - **Post-Deployment Monitoring**: After each service migration, closely monitor system health, latency, error rates, and business metrics.
   - **Performance Tuning**: Adjust resource allocation and service configurations based on real-world load.
   - **Cost Analysis and Optimization**: Regularly review AWS costs against projections and implement optimization strategies (e.g., rightsizing, Savings Plans).
   - **Retire Monolith**: Once the final module is extracted, plan the final shutdown of the monolith application and its dedicated infrastructure.
   - **Post-Mortem and Knowledge Sharing**: After each significant migration milestone, document lessons learned an
## 8. Long-Term Operations & Maintenance
   - **Automated Operations**: Configure auto-scaling for each service and implement automated backup, disaster recovery drills.
   - **Runbooks & On-call**: Maintain incident response playbooks and ensure proper on-call coverage.
   - **Governance and Standards Evolution**: Regularly review and update architectural standards, security policies, and cost management practices.
   - **Continuous Improvement**: Collect feedback, measure SLOs, and continuously refine services and processes.
